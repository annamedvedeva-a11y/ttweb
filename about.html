            Hi! My name is Anya Medvedeva, and I am a tenth-grade student. I have been playing table tennis my whole life, since I was 5. I am currently ranked among the top 12 players in Sweden in my age category and have recently become a Stockholm championship medalist. During my two years at this school, I noticed that table tennis is a popular activity among students here. I have never seen a free table tennis table on the first floor yet:)
