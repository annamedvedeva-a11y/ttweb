<h2>Lesson 1 - Basics of Table Tennis Rules</h2> 
<p>Table tennis, as you probably already know, is a popular racket sport where players hit a lightweight ball back and forth over a net on a rectangular table, aiming to make the opponent fail to return it legally. But what does “legally” mean?</p> <h3>Your shot counts only if…</h3> <ul> <li>The ball hits your side of the table once, goes over the net, and lands on the opponent’s side.</li> <li>You hit the ball with the racket (not your hand or body).</li> <li>The ball clears the net without touching anything else.</li> </ul> <p>So how do you win a point? It's simple: When your opponent did not meet at least one of the conditions above.</p> <h3>How does the scoring system work?</h3> <p>One set is usually played to 11 points. However, the important notice is that you must win by at least 2 points. For example, 11:9 is fine, but a score of 11:10 is tied, so you keep playing until the difference is 2 points. Matches are usually best of 3 or 5 sets; however, at national and international tournaments, it might be best of 7.</p> <h3>How does the game start? Are there any rules for a serve?</h3> <ul> <li>The ball must rest on an open palm before serving.</li> <li>The ball must be tossed upward (not thrown forward).</li> <li>The serve must bounce once on your side and once on the opponent’s side.</li> <li>The serve must go over the net without touching it; otherwise, you get a re-serve.</li> <li>Players change serve every 2 points.</li> </ul> <h3>Other basic faults and common mistakes:</h3> <ul> <li>The ball hits the table twice on one side.</li> <li>The ball goes off the table without touching the opponent’s side.</li> <li>The player touches the table with their free hand.</li> <li>The player hits the ball before it bounces (except in doubles or special cases).</li> </ul> <div class="lesson-back">

    <h2>Lesson 2 - Mini Games and Exercises for Beginners</h2>

        <!-- LEFT SIDE — SCRIPT / TEXT -->
        <div class="lesson-text">

<p>When I just started playing, small games and exercises were my favorite part. These games not only help you improve your feeling and ball control (which is crucial later when learning spins), but also your focus and perseverance. Here are some of my favorite exercises:</p> <h3>Ball Balancing / Holding the Ball</h3> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Improve hand stability, focus, and racket control.</p> <p><strong>How to do:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Place the ball on your racket and try to keep it resting there for as long as possible.</li> <li>Start standing still, but if it's too simple, try moving slowly around the table while keeping the ball balanced.</li> <li>To make it even harder, switch hands or tilt the racket slightly, challenging your control.</li> </ul> <h3>Ball Bouncing / Racket Juggling</h3> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Develop ball control, coordination, and focus.</p> <p><strong>How to do:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Place the ball on your racket and try to keep it bouncing as many times as possible without it falling.</li> <li>Start with small, gentle taps and try alternating forehand and backhand.</li> <li>Challenge yourself: count how many consecutive hits you can make or try switching hands.</li> <li>For advanced difficulty, try moving around the table while keeping the ball on the racket.</li> </ul> <h3>Wall Bouncing</h3> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Improve ball control and timing.</p> <p><strong>How to do:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Hit the ball against a wall, trying to keep the rhythm the same and not let it drop.</li> <li>Start slow, then gradually increase the speed.</li> <li>This was actually my favorite exercise! My coach always regretted assigning it to me because I never stopped, and the constant sound of the bouncing ball made him mad.</li> </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 3 - Physical Training for Table Tennis</h2>

    <div class="lesson-layout">

        <!-- LEFT SIDE — SCRIPT / TEXT -->
        <div class="lesson-text">

            <p>Physical training is essential for success in table tennis. The main reason is that strong legs and good footwork form the foundation of a player's performance. Although table tennis players move in smaller spaces compared to other racket sports, they rely heavily on leg power to strike and quickly return to a neutral stance. Therefore, table tennis is more physically demanding than it appears, requiring not only skill but also excellent physical fitness and great endurance.</p> <h3>1. Jump Squats</h3> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Start standing with feet shoulder-width apart and jump as high as you can, swinging your arms for momentum. After, land softly and immediately go into a chair squat position (knees at 90°). Repeat for several reps; I recommend doing 25 repetitions 4 times with a break in between. This exercise is one of the hardest, so increase repetitions gradually.</p> <p>This exercise engages muscles like quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves.</p> <h3>2. Chair Hold (Wall Sit)</h3> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Stand with your back against a wall. Slide down until your thighs are parallel to the ground, as if sitting in an invisible chair. Hold this position for 20 to 60 seconds.</p> <p>This exercise helps develop muscles like glutes and hamstrings, as well as the core.</p> <h3>3. Jumping Lunges</h3> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Start in a lunge position with one foot forward and one foot back. Jump up as high as you can and switch legs in midair. Land softly with the opposite leg forward and repeat.</p> <p>This exercise develops muscles like quadriceps, glutes, and calves.</p> <h3>Why are these exercises good for table tennis?</h3> <p>These exercises develop leg strength, explosive power, and endurance. This helps a player perform quick lateral movements and fast direction changes, maintain low and stable positions for better balance, and execute explosive pushes and rapid steps during fast rallies.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 4 - Technical Shots: Backhand and Forehand</h2>

    <div class="lesson-layout">

        <!-- LEFT SIDE — SCRIPT / TEXT -->
        <div class="lesson-text">

<p>After you have mastered the racket control exercises and completed some physical training, you can start learning the basic table tennis shots: forehand and backhand. These are the two most used shots in table tennis.</p> <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Perform a Forehand Loop</h3> <ul> <li>Stand sideways to the table with your right leg slightly back if you are right-handed. Place your feet shoulder-width apart, bend your knees, and lean your weight slightly forward. This is your starting preparation.</li> <li>Hold the racket up, arm slightly bent, with a small gap between your elbow and body.</li> <li>Brush up the back/top of the ball, accelerating your racket forward and upward as you make contact at the peak of the bounce.</li> <li>Shift your weight from your back foot to your front foot.</li> </ul> <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Perform a Backhand Loop</h3> <ul> <li>Stand sideways to the table, knees bent, weight slightly forward, ready to move. This setup is the same for both backhand and forehand shots.</li> <li>Bring the racket back to waist height, keeping it in front of your body, with the racket face slightly closed.</li> <li>Rotate your upper body and swing forward from your elbow, not just your arm, keeping the elbow out slightly.</li> <li>Rotate your hips and core through the shot for power, returning to a balanced stance after contact.</li> </ul> <p>That's your first step into practicing how to play! Good luck!</p>

    <h2>Lesson 5 - Combination Shots and Reaction Speed Improvement</h2>

    <div class="lesson-layout">

        <!-- LEFT SIDE — SCRIPT / TEXT -->
        <div class="lesson-text">

<p>Once you’ve mastered basic forehand and backhand shots, the next step is learning how to combine them smoothly during a rally. In table tennis, rallies are fast, and the key to keeping the ball in play is quick thinking, quick reactions, and smooth transitions between shots.</p> <h3>What Are Combination Shots?</h3> <p>Combination shots are when you use different types of strokes in a row. The best combinations to start with are:</p> <ul> <li>Forehand → Backhand → Forehand</li> <li>Backhand ×2 → Forehand ×2</li> </ul> <h3>Advanced Reaction Exercises ("Unusual Situations")</h3> <p>For more advanced players, try more difficult exercises called <strong>"unusual situations"</strong>. The main goal of these exercises is that you do not know where the ball will come next.</p> <p><strong>Examples:</strong></p> <ul> <li> Backhand ×1 → Forehand 1 to 3 times <br> (Your opponent can play to your forehand between one and three times, and you don’t know exactly when they will switch back to your backhand.) </li> <li> Backhand ×1 → Forehand (middle or wide) <br> (Your opponent decides where the ball goes, so you don’t know exactly where the ball will come from.) </li> </ul> <h3>Why Is It Useful?</h3> <p>These exercises help you develop reaction speed and reflexes, improve footwork and positioning, stay calm and focused in unpredictable situations, and build better control, timing, and decision-making during real matches.</p> <h3>Important Notes for Beginners</h3> <ul> <li>Don’t focus on power yet; instead, work on accuracy and timing.</li> <li>Practice regularly in short sessions; even 5–10 minutes a day makes a big difference.</li> </ul> <p>Remember, the most important thing is practice. The more you practice, the better your muscle memory remembers the movements and how to perform them.</p>

<section id="lesson6"> <h2>Lesson 6 - Psychology and Concentration in the Game</h2> <p><strong>!This section is only relevant if you do or plan on doing competitive table tennis!</strong></p> <p>Table tennis is not only a physical sport, it is also a mental game. Even if you have mastered all the shots perfectly and placed 10/10 balls on the table, it does not guarantee good performance in competitions. Of course, strong technique and strategies give you a solid base, but the most important factor is knowing how to apply them in stressful situations.</p> <p>Around 50% of your game is decided by your confidence and focus. Because the ball moves fast and points are short, players must stay focused, calm, and confident at all times. Good concentration not only helps you make better decisions, but also react faster and stay consistent during matches.</p> <p>Here are some of my personal methods to calm down before an important match. Players who stay calm and focused make fewer mistakes and enjoy the game more.</p> <h3>Simple Exercises to Improve Concentration</h3> <h4>1. Breathing Technique (Calm Reset)</h4> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 4 seconds, then exhale slowly through your mouth for 4 seconds. Repeat 1 or 2 times between points or before the match.</p> <h4>2. Muscle Tension & Release (Clench Your Fist)</h4> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Strongly clench your fist for 3 seconds, then fully relax your hand and fingers. You can also tense and relax your shoulders the same way. Repeat 1 or 2 times when you feel nervous.</p> <h4>3. “Take Your Time” Technique</h4> <p><strong>How to do it:</strong> Before serving or receiving, pause for 2 to 3 seconds and take one slow breath. Focus only on the next point, not the score.</p>
